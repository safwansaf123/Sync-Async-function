=> Aysnc =  multiple works at a time, is used no wait is required
aysncio python builtin module which is used where function takes time,
so aysncio module not allow to wait work quickly dosent wait work fast 


=> Sync = one by one work, is used where simple work step by step work is required, in 

=> "from agents import Agent"
Typically refers to using the OpenAI Agents SDK, a Python framework for building intelligent, multi-agent systems
agent is class

You're telling Python: “Hey, I want to use something called Agent, and it lives inside a folder (or library) called agents.”
Now, what is Agent?
- An Agent is like a smart little helper you create in your code.
- You can give it a name, some instructions (like “act like a polite travel guide”), and even let it use tools (like calling a search engine or doing math).
- The Agent is your team member. You tell it what kind of job it should do—like “Be a helpful assistant” or “Answer math questions.”

=> "from agents import Runner"
- The Runner is the boss. It gives the Agent a task, watches it do the work, and brings back the result.
- you’re basically saying, “Hey Python, I want to use the Runner so I can send messages to my Agent and get answers back.”


Absolutely! Let's imagine you're opening a small pizza restaurant:
- Agent is like your pizza chef 👨‍🍳. You tell the chef what kind of pizzas to make—maybe “make only vegetarian pizzas” or “always use extra cheese.”
- Runner is the waiter 🧑‍🍳. The waiter takes the customer’s order (like “one Margherita pizza, please”), goes to the chef with the request, waits for the pizza to be ready, and then brings it back to the customer.
So when your program runs:
- You create your chef (Agent) and tell them how they should work.
- The waiter (Runner) takes people’s questions or requests, passes them to the chef, and returns the answer.
Super simple, right? You're the boss in this setup! Want to try building your own mini pizza kitchen (in code 😄)

=> "from agents import AsyncOpenAI" 
typically appears in Python code that uses an AI-related software library or framework where an agent system is being implemented.
- AsyncOpenAI: This is the specific class, function, or object being imported from the agents module. The Async part suggests it’s designed to run asynchronously, meaning it can perform operations like calling the OpenAI API without blocking the rest of your program


=> "from agents import OpenAIChatCompletionsModel"
- This is likely a class or model wrapper specifically designed to interact with the OpenAI Chat Completions API, such as GPT-4, using structured input/output.

💬 What is OpenAIChatCompletionsModel?
Think of it like a smart helper that knows how to:
- Talk to ChatGPT (like me! 😄)
- Send questions or prompts
- Understand and return the answers

🔧 Why it's useful
If you're writing a program that wants to chat with an AI, this helper (or “model”) handles the hard work of:
- Connecting to OpenAI
- Sending your questions
- Getting a smart response back

Why not just use the API directly?
Great question! Here’s why using OpenAIChatCompletionsModel is easier:
| Without the Model | With OpenAIChatCompletionsModel | 
            
            "without model"                                   "with OpenAIChatCompletionsModel"
            
| You write all the API code manually 🧱                   | You just call one function ✅ | 
| You handle JSON formatting, errors, timeouts 😩          | The model handles all that for you 🤖 | 
| Takes more time and effort ⏳                             | Saves time and fewer bugs 🚀 | 



=> ""from agents.run import run config"
So in short: RunConfig helps set the rules for how an AI agent should behave when it runs. Kind of like giving your digital assistant a game plan before it starts working 

example: 
config = RunConfig(
    model="gpt-4",
    max_steps=5,
    tools=["search_web", "math_solver"],
    verbose=True
)
import Asyncio 
The asyncio module in Python is used for asynchronous programming, allowing you to write code that runs concurrently without 
using threads or processes. It’s perfect for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting—like network requests, file I/O, or user input


⚙️ What import asyncio Enables
- Creating coroutines
Functions defined with async def that can pause and resume using await.
- Running event loops
The core of asyncio—manages and schedules asynchronous tasks.
- Concurrent task execution
Use asyncio.gather() or asyncio.create_task() to run multiple coroutines at once.
- Non-blocking I/O
Ideal for socket programming, web scraping, or APIs where you don’t want to freeze the app while waiting.
- Timers and delays
Use await asyncio.sleep(seconds) to pause without blocking other tasks.
